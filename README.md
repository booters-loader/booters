# Welcome to `booters`

This is an experiment to create a new, libre bootloader for Android, UEFI
(arm64/x86_64), and other embedded targets.

The history of this project stems from my dissatisfaction of chipset OEMs using
permissively-licensed bootloaders for their boot process, and not contributing
back. That, combined with a lack of documented and reviewed code, led to the
creation of this project.

For example, I was trying to hack on a GUI to the LK bootloader (now DMCA'd,
point in hand) for the Astro Slide by Planet Computers. This was an bad
developer experience with the codebase, and I wanted something more readable to
hack with. This bootloader keeps that desire alive.
